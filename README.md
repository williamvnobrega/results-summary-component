## My process

I initiated the project by designing the wireframe using the Figma so that I could get all the sizes. Following this, I proceeded to produce the mockup version and subsequently embarked on the coding phase.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - React framework

### What I learned

This marks my initial experience utilizing Sass for stylization purposes. Through this endeavor, I gained valuable knowledge and insights that I intend to apply in forthcoming projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://medium.com/frontendweb/how-to-read-local-json-file-in-react-js-564125235fc7) - This helped me to get the data from json files.
   
- [Resource 2](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react#start-with-the-mockup) - This is an amazing article which helped me in understanding how to start a project from scratch. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
